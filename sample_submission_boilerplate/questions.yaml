task: >
  Using the data in the data folder and the provided workflows in the workflow folder,
  answer the following questions about the GSD4 trio whole-exome sequencing mini-benchmark
  (Harsono et al., 2024, DOI: 10.1016/j.dib.2024.111231). You must run the provided workflows.
  Do not create any synthetic data. Do not translate the provided workflow into a different language.

questions:

      How many reads from each of the three samples (father, mother, proband)
      successfully aligned to the GRCh38 chr3 reference sequence?
    answer_type: integer_per_sample  # expects a per-sample mapping of counts
    tolerance_percent: 5              # 5% tolerance on each sample’s count

  - id: q2
    stage: variant_calling
    text: |
      How many SNPs and indels are present in the trio VCF file?
    answer_type: integer_pair         # expects two integers: snps, indels
    tolerance: 5                      # allow small absolute drift (e.g., ±5)
